## Which state has the highest percentage of elderly people (age > 85) in their population?

I was starting to figure out that I'd need to analyze these more, so started doing more sorting.  In this case, Alaska
had the fewest elderly people (too cold?) at .23%, whereas Iowa had the most at 1.98%.  As I have relatives in Nebraska
 (third place) this doesn't surprise me.  It may not be a retirement location, but people don't leave, and live long
 lives.
