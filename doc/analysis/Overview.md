# Overview

FYI: Per Piazza, all analyses will disregard VI and PR, as the numbers are not correct.

### Code overview
The code matures over time as I figured out better ways to do things.  Rather than string packing and unpacking, by Q3 I was 
using a data class that implemented the Writable interface to store data.  This had much better results.

My Job classes generally would take the output file, reparse it, and put out data in the format desired.  My string
formatting skills improved over time, such that the first few questions are a bit hard to read the results of.
